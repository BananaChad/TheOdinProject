    <p>Chicken Lazone</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons smoked paprika</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons onion powder</li>
      <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1/2 lemon, juiced</li>
      <li>2/3 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1/3 cup water</li>
      <li>1/4 cup sliced green onions</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cold butter, cubed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix chili powder, smoked paprika, cayenne, black pepper, garlic powder,
        and onion powder together in a small bowl; set aside. Half will be used
        for the chicken rub and half for the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season chicken on both sides with salt. Sprinkle half the spice mixture
        over both sides of chicken. Wrap and refrigerate for 1 hour (or up to
        overnight), or until ready to cook.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a heavy-duty nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Sear
        chicken, turning once, about 3 to 4 minutes per side; chicken will be
        about 75% cooked at this point, and will finish cooking in the sauce.
        Turn off heat; transfer chicken to a plate and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add remaining spice mixture to the pan and stir around in the hot oil
        for 30 seconds. Add lemon juice, cream, and water. Stir in a pinch of
        salt. Add remaining spice mixture to the pan and stir around in the hot
        oil for 30 seconds. Add lemon juice, cream, and water. Stir in a pinch
        of salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce
        to medium-low and return chicken to the pan along with any accumulated
        juices. Simmer gently, turning occasionally to coat with sauce, until
        chicken is no longer pink at the center and juices run clear, 8 to 10
        minutes. Time will vary based on size of chicken breasts. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted near the center will read 165 degrees
        F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to low and add green onions and butter. Stir into the sauce,
        while also basting chicken with the sauce. Taste for seasoning and
        serve.
